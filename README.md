# Harry Potter Trivia Game

## Project Functionality
This is a game for web browsers where the user answers a number of questions.  Radio buttons represent 4 possible answers to each question. The radio buttons mean only 1 answer can be provided. As soon as the game starts, a timer begins, and when the timer expires, the game ends and the results are shown. The user can opt to see the results earlier by clicking a Done button. Results for correct answers, incorrect answers and unanswered questions are shown.

## Project Usefulness
This project demonstrates the applicaton of the jQuery library including click events, a timer, content being hidden and displayed, and updates to the HTML file based on user behavior. 

## How to get started
On page load, the user just needs to click Start to start the game. The user can play as many times as they wish by refreshing the page, but the questions remain the same.
